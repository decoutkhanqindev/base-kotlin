# 📚 Learning Kotlin Basics

This repository compiles examples, exercises, and fundamental knowledge about the Kotlin programming language. It is suitable for beginners to get familiar with Kotlin through practical examples, small exercises, and important topics such as OOP, lambda, coroutine, etc.

## 🏆 Main Topics
- **Kotlin Basics**: Variables, data types, operators, and basic syntax.
- **Control Flow**: Conditional statements (if, when) and loops (for, while).
- **Functions**: Function definitions, parameters, return values, and higher-order functions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces, and encapsulation.
- **Delegation**: Built-in delegation, delegated properties, and lazy initialization.
- **Lambdas & Functional Programming**: Lambda expressions and functional programming concepts.
- **Multithreading & Coroutines**: Working with threads and Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous programming.
- **Practical Exercises**: Hands-on exercises for each topic to reinforce learning.
